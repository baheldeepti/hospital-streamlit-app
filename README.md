## 💡 Why I Built This

As a kidney transplant recipient, I spent nearly two months in a hospital — not just as a patient, but also as an observer of how data was used (and misused). That journey inspired me to build a healthcare BI assistant that bridges the gap between complex data and human decision-making.

This project brings together my experience as a Business Intelligence Engineer and my personal experience as a patient.
